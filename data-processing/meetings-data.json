            "abstract": "In this talk, I will explore the challenge of evaluating the robustness of embedding models in real-world applications where users may introduce subtle edits to text, such typos, negations, dialect shifts, and entity replacements. This issue is particularly prevalent in misinformation contexts, where claims evolve as they spread online, yet embedding models are typically trained and tested on clean, static datasets that fail to capture real-world variability. I will discuss why measuring robustness in these dynamic settings is difficult and how conventional benchmarks like MTEB overlook linguistic diversity in the wild. I will then introduce our framework that uses LLMs as both perturbers and verifiers to generate valid, natural claim variations, enabling systematic robustness evaluation of embedding models multi-stage retrieval pipelines (first-stage retrieval and reranking). Finally, I will present results from a large-scale comparison of BERT, T5, and LLM-distilled models, and outline mitigation approaches to improve robustness in noisy, evolving real-world text.",

            "sessionType": "seminar",
            "abstract": "This talk predicts my thesis, which investigates sentiment classification and analysis methodologies for detecting online harm in social media content, with the objective of identifying and predicting dangerous viral text trends whilst exploring the deployment of automated counter-speech mechanisms to mitigate toxicity. The proliferation of social media platforms has generated an immense, continuously expanding data stream where users, exploiting perceived anonymity and free speech protections, can inflict significant harm. Current automated moderation systems demonstrate notable inadequacies in addressing toxic behaviour, occasionally resulting in severe consequences including the propagation of violent extremist content, cyberbullying, and suicide ideation. This research aims to identify and predict harmful speech within subjective topical domains through novel methodological frameworks and algorithmic approaches, specifically targeting early detection before contentious topics escalate into widespread weaponised trends. The methodology employs mathematical algorithms to quantify and analyse captured content, facilitating predictive modelling for hate speech emergence patterns. The study evaluates multiple computational tools, processes, and methodological approaches through comparative analysis. Various techniques for categorising social media sentiment are assessed across dimensions including \"Toxicity,\" \"Aggression,\" \"Attacking,\" and \"Neutral\" classifications, utilising existing open-source sentiment analysis tools and historical Wikipedia datasets. Machine learning and data science techniques are systematically applied to enhance sentiment scoring accuracy, with comprehensive evaluation of tool reliability in sentiment capture tasks. Temporal analysis leverages original Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) timestamps as reference points for forecasting hate speech trends through stable state analysis, probability distributions, Markov Chains, stable state similarities, and optimisation techniques to identify emergent harmful viral patterns within specific topical domains. This comprehensive multi-methodological approach to detecting and predicting online hate speech patterns through complementary sentiment analysis procedures contributed to a publication at ECML PKDD SoGood 2022, with four additional papers currently in development. The predictive intelligence acquired through these techniques was subsequently integrated with generative tools to synthesise synthetic toxic conversations based on original seed content, enabling proactive countermeasure development as the next phase towards mitigating hate speech in pursuit of \"#EndOnlineHarm.\" Keywords - Classification; Counter-Speech; Detection; Generative AI; Heuristics; Jaccard Similarities; Large Language Models; Machine Learning; Markov Chains; Online Harm; Sentiment Analysis; Time Series Analysis.",

Mahmud Akter (QMUL) has kindly volunteered to lead the discussion on: \"NLP Security and Ethics, in the Wild\" by Lent et al. (2025), presented at TACL Brief Paper Summary: This work examines how NLP security research often operates in an ethical \"gray zone,\" lacking established frameworks from cybersecurity ethics like harm minimization, coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and responsible public disclosure. The authors surveyed 80 NLP security papers and found that many fail to adopt cybersecurity's ethical best practices, potentially benefiting attackers more than defenders. This paper connects well with our ongoing theme of research ethics in the NLP community and should spark interesting discussions about responsible disclosure, potential misuse, and cross-disciplinary ethical frameworks.",

            "abstract": "In this talk, we will highlight our recent efforts to improve relation extraction by addressing the critical challenge of mitigating entity bias in \"large\" language models. We will begin by discussing the importance of relation extraction in various domains, with a specific focus on finance. We will examine the current performance of using \"large\" language models, including both encoder-decoder and decoder-only architectures, and identify the limitations of these approaches, particularly their tendency to rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor generalization. We will then introduce our novel approach using the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework, which compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across general, financial, and biomedical domains, in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Finally, we will discuss the insights gained from our approach, emphasizing its interpretable methodology and exploring future research directions to further enhance relation extraction techniques.",

            "sessionType": "seminar",
            "abstract": "The session will explore the current state and future directions of reasoning capabilities in large language models, covering both the assessment of reasoning through claim verification and novel approaches to enhance logical reasoning through symbolic methods. Abstract 1: Although LLMs have shown great performance on Mathematics and Coding related reasoning tasks, the reasoning capabilities of LLMs regarding other forms of reasoning are still an open problem. Here, we examine the issue of reasoning from the perspective of claim verification. We propose a framework designed to break down any claim paired with evidence into atomic reasoning types that are necessary for verification. We use this framework to create RECV, the first claim verification benchmark, incorporating real-world claims, to assess the deductive and abductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprises of three datasets, covering reasoning problems of increasing complexity. We evaluate three state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs under multiple prompt settings. Our results show that while LLMs can address deductive reasoning problems, they consistently fail in cases of abductive reasoning. Moreover, we observe that enhancing LLMs with rationale generation is not always beneficial. Nonetheless, we find that generated rationales are semantically similar to those provided by humans, especially in deductive reasoning cases. Abstract 2: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by generating symbolic reasoning trajectories and select the high-quality ones using a process reward model automatically tuned based on Monte Carlo estimation. The trajectories are then employed via fine-tuning methods to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on logical reasoning benchmarks such as FOLIO and LogicAsker show the effectiveness of the proposed method with large gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of symbolically-guided process supervision in alleviating the effect of memorization on LLM reasoning.",
